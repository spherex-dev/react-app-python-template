# Starter React Template with a Python Backend

This starter template combines a react single page application with a python sanic backend. Modifications have been added to the sanic backend to allow cors from any host to interact with the single page app during the development phase.

## Prerequisites

To use this template, ensure that the following commands are available in your environment

- yarn or npm (if npm is used, modify `setup.sh` to use the `npm` command instead of yarn)
- virtualenv for installation of a python virtual environment

## Installation

Installation of this application can be done using the `setup.sh` script provided in the root of this project.

The required node packages will be installed will be installed using `yarn`. However if you prefer to use `npm` please modify `setup.sh` script to use `npm` instead.

the `backend` directory will contain the python code which runs a [sanic](https://sanic.dev/) server to run the backend service. Sanic is very similar to flask, however is based on async code which uses the `uvloop` which is very performant.

## Demo Code

Before running this application, ensure that the backend is running by calling `yarn start-sanic-test`. The test version of the sanic server that allows permissive `CORS` access will allow your local running instance of the react page to communicate with the backend server. The backend server will also have an `auto_reload` flag set when running in testing mode will whill allow for rapid development.

The `App.js` for this demo application is modified to perform a fetch from the backend and will perform a fetch against the `api/hello/hello` url to show that data is being fetched. You should see `Greeting from backend is world` when the fetch is successful.

## Testing

`yarn test` has been augmentedto call `yarn start-sanic-test` then run jest and then terminate the `sanic` server once tests are complete. the `react-scripts test` command has been also been updated to proxy test requests to `http://localhost:8000`

## Modifications

The following block of code has been removed from `package.json` as this causes problems when making changes to the javascript code with the following error ` "Failed to load config "react-app" to extend from."`.

```
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  },
```
